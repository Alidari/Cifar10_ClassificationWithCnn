# Cifar10_ClassificationWithCnn
This project performs image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CIFAR-10 is a popular dataset containing a total of 60,000 color images across 10 different classes. The project involves training and testing the model on this dataset to evaluate its classification accuracy.

Features
- Data Preprocessing: Includes resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation techniques.
- Model Architecture: Comprises a multi-layer CNN structure equipped with dropout and batch normalization layers.
- Training: Utilizes optimizers such as SGD and Adam for model training and performance optimization.
- Evaluation: Measures the accuracy and loss on the test dataset to assess model performance.
